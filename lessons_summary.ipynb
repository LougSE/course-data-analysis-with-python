    "# Lesson Summary\n",
    "## Module 1\n",
    "Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know: \n",
    "\n",
    "Each line in a dataset is a row, and commas separate the values.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the data, you must analyze the attributes for each column of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python libraries are collections of functions and methods that facilitate various functionalities without writing code from scratch and are categorized into Scientific Computing, Data Visualization, and Machine Learning Algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many data science libraries are interconnected; for instance, Scikit-learn is built on top of NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data format and the file path are two key factors for reading data with Pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "The read_CSV method in Pandas can read files in CSV format into a Pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas has unique data types like object, float, Int, and datetime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the dtype method to check each column’s data type; misclassified data types might need manual correction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing the correct data types helps apply appropriate Python functions to specific columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Statistical Summary with describe() provides count, mean, standard deviation, min, max, and quartile ranges for numerical columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use include='all' as an argument to get summaries for object-type columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The statistical summary helps identify potential issues like outliers needing further attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the info() Method gives an overview of the top and bottom 30 rows of the DataFrame, useful for quick visual inspection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some statistical metrics may return \"NaN,\" indicating missing values, and the program can’t calculate statistics for that specific data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python can connect to databases through specialized code, often written in Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and Python DB APIs (most often used) facilitate the interaction between Python and the DBMS.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL APIs connect to DBMS with one or more API calls, build SQL statements as a text string, and use API calls to send SQL statements to the DBMS and retrieve results and statuses.\n",
    "\n",
    "DB-API, Python's standard for interacting with relational databases, uses connection objects to establish and manage database connections and cursor objects to run queries and scroll through the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Connection Object methods include the cursor(), commit(), rollback(), and close() commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can import the database module, use the Connect API to open a connection, and then create a cursor object to run queries and fetch results. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to close the database connection to free up resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Module 2\n",
    "Lesson Summary\n",
    "Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data formatting is critical for making data from various sources consistent and comparable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Master the techniques in Python to convert units of measurement, like transforming \"city miles per gallon\" to \"city-liters per 100 kilometers\" for ease of comparison and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Acquire skills to identify and correct data types in Python, ensuring the data is accurately represented for subsequent statistical analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data normalization helps make variables comparable and helps eliminate inherent biases in statistical models.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can apply Feature Scaling, Min-Max, and Z-Score to normalize data and apply each technique in Python using pandas’ methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binning is a method of data pre-processing to improve model accuracy and data visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run binning techniques in Python using numpy's \"linspace\" and pandas' \"cut\" methods, particularly for numerical variables like \"price.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Utilize histograms to visualize the distribution of binned data and gain insights into feature distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical models generally require numerical inputs, making it necessary to convert categorical variables like \"fuel type\" into numerical formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can implement the one-hot encoding technique in Python using pandas’ get_dummies method to transform categorical variables into a format suitable for machine learning models.\n",
